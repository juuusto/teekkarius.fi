  "paljukatsomo-body": "What could be better than watching the Ice Hockey World Championships in good company? Watching it from a hot tub of course! Teekkarius 150 event committee invites all hot tub enjoyers, ice hockey fans and anyone who enjoys a fun atmosphere to join in on an outdoor hot tub screening for the quarter final games on the 26.5. at Alvari square!\nIt is possible to rent a hot tub from the screening for your friend group’s private use. There are 10 hot tubs available for reservation and each fits around 8 people at a time. The reservation for a tub is 60 euros, but there are also two hot tubs available for common use for free. In addition to the tubs, there is also free-for-all table seating for around 90 people. You may also bring your own hot tubs, tables, chairs or picnic blankets if you wish.\nThe reservation of the private hot tubs will be open on 10.5. between 12-16, and the reservations will be raffled from all of those who signed up during this time.\nThe quarter finals will be played at 16.20 and 20.20. When Finland is not playing, we will vote amongst the spectators for what game will be screened.\nPS. In the unfortunate event that Finland would not play in the quarter finals, the event will be pivoted into a movie screening.",

  "tpj-body": "Registration for the 150th Teekkari Tradition Party is open to guests from 1.-15.6. and for students and alumni 22.6-31.7. Registration takes place at kide.app, for which you need your own account in order to be able to buy products from there. You need to create an account beforhand you and if you need help creating an account, you can find it at:",
  "tpj-body-2": "kide.app works both on a website and as an application on a mobile phone. \nWhen registering, you will be asked for information for the event, for example an email address where all future information related to the party will be sent to. When registering, you choose from 5 different ticket price options: a student-priced ticket (100 €), an alumni-priced ticket (150 €) or three different support-priced tickets (150 €, 200 € or 300 €). Once you have selected a ticket, you will be presented with a view to fill in your registration information and the system will reserve the ticket for you for 25 minutes, during which you can fill in your information. \nUpon registration, you will also have the opportunity to purchase a ticket for your possible avec. This option opens when you add the selected ticket to your shopping cart and the form opens. One of the options is to buy an avec ticket (please note that you must also choose their own ticket price for your avec, i.e. the avec ticket is not automatically the same as your own ticket). You will then have the opportunity to fill in the avec registration information. When you click on a ticket to the shopping cart, it will not automatically book two tickets, but you will have to click on the avec ticket from the form separately, so that the system will also book your avec ticket. \nPlease note that if you choose the avec option you will have to pay for both tickets at the same time when you check out, as well as fill in both details before purchasing. Once you have clicked on the tickets in your shopping cart, the system will keep the tickets reserved for you for 25 minutes, allowing you to fill in both registration details. \nSo when you buy a ticket, you don't automatically buy a ticket for your potential avec, but you have to click on it separately. If you do not want an avec ticket, just leave the box blank. \nWhen you are registering, primary and secondary table party requests will also be asked. We recommend that you think about these in advance and, for example, come up with a name or common notation for your own table party that everyone will write down. This will make it easier for us to seat you together. Registration information can be edited in kide.app until 7.8. and after this the registration is binding and the ticket can no longer be canceled nor is a refund possible.\nThe Code of Conduct of the Aalto University Student Union is also in use at the event, which must be approved by each participant in order to purchase a ticket. With this, we want to ensure that the event is a safe and compassionate event for every participant. We do not tolerate any form of bullying or discrimination in the event. For more information on the Student Union Code of Conduct below. \n",
